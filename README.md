Cricket Stance Analyzer

The Cricket Stance Analyzer is an AI-powered Python application that analyzes a user's cricket batting stance from images and provides suggestions for improvements. It uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and evaluate key aspects of a player's stance and suggest necessary corrections to enhance their technique.

Features
Image Analysis: Analyzes the cricket batting stance from images.

Corrections & Suggestions: Provides suggestions to improve stance based on the analysis.

AI Model: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify posture and positioning errors.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to upload their images and receive feedback.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Libraries: opencv-python, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, pillow, scikit-learn
